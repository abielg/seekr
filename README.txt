You must install Exponent in order to run the app. 

Limitations:

There is no backend, so user input (profile information, payment info, etc.) is not stored and hardcoded instead. When the user inputs a location, this location is not stored, and the length of activity and number of people is not stored either. There are not profiles for every person on the feed, and they all link to Eesha’s profile as an example. Since there is no other user using it at the same time, the timer is set to a minimal time wait to get the experience of waiting for an acceptance. On the on the way page, since there is no other user, the “how far away” information is hardcoded but set to a wait time for the same reason. User inputs for where to go next also do not work but are implemented visually to show that there is a search option. There are also limited suggested spots to choose from, and the routes displayed are not live maps but static images to show the path taken. On the Trip Summary page, the route is again a static image and doesn’t 100% reflect the route chosen by the user but does include all the same stops. On the Trip Playback, there is no camera roll integration, so pictures are displayed to the user.
